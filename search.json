    "text": "“Even learning very basic programming, even if you’re not very good at it, I think it totally transforms the idea of what you’re doing with that computer, or what a computer should be able to do for you.”\n\nFor the past year or so, Dr Michael Radich, Senior Lecturer in VUW’s Religious Studies Programme, has set aside an hour a day to learn Python, a widely-used, high-level computer language. It’s not common for someone in his field (he specialises in the study of Buddhist texts) to delve this far into the world of programming, but it’s the kind of disciplined dedication that’s enabled him to gain a degree in music composition, a PhD from Harvard, and teach himself no less than ten natural languages.\nDuring an hour-and-a-half long discussion over coffee at Milk and Honey, I learn that getting to grips with his first programming language has been one of the most frustrating endeavours of his career, but also one of the most rewarding.\n“I was worried the learning curve would be too long and steep. Now I’ve reached that good point where I figure the process is so intrinsically worthwhile that the calculus of input to endpoint has become immaterial.”\nIn other words, the payoff has proved to be well worth the time invested, even though “it drives me up the wall quite regularly, and I spit the dummy fairly regularly too.”\nThe reason I’ve pinned him down for an interview is that Michael belongs to a new generation of humanities researchers embracing computational methods and quantitative analysis to challenge assumptions, find new ways to answer time-honoured questions, and to ask new ones.\nHis story, like many in this space of digital research, begins with a particular problem; in his case it’s how to accurately determine authorship of select parts of the 3000 canonical Chinese Buddhist texts. To get a sense of the scale Michael’s dealing with, the Chinese Buddhist canon is 243 times larger than all the biblical texts combined. Imagine a set of those Encyclopaedia Britannicas you see forlornly collecting dust at your local Sally Army store — you’d need over four of those to match the canon’s 188 million words.\nDuring a kind of cultural ‘arms race’ in the 90s, however, Japan, Korea and Taiwan all competed to be the first to digitise the full Buddhist canon. Researchers in the field now have access to not one but three digitised versions of the entire corpus. Seeing an opportunity to dig deeper, Michael teamed up with local developer Jamie Norrish to create an open-source tool called TACL (Textual Analysis for Corpus Linguistics), which helps sift through millions of Chinese character strings and returns an avalanche of raw data to explore further.\nIf the Chinese Buddhist canon is the proverbial haystack, think of TACL as a well-calibrated metal detector capable of pointing the way to more needles than anyone realised even existed. But as Michael contends, to fruitfully sort the desired needles from misleading shrapnel takes the disciplinary knowledge of a human expert. TACL allows for increased exploratory power, but Michael’s extensive and hard-earned expertise provides the explanatory power needed to frame this wealth of evidence in a way which maximises impact and minimises misunderstanding.\nIt’s a great example of the kind of rich analysis and argument made possible when the minds of machine and man work in tandem. As Michael points out, “Computers are just weird collaborators.”\nOver the course of our conversation I’m reminded that even when a topic is esoteric and arcane, a researcher’s passion can be infectious, bridging the gap between the minute details of a disciplinary rabbit hole and the general interest of a layperson such as myself. Seemingly curious and critical in equal measures, I love how Michael’s calm, considered manner gives way to a boyish enthusiasm when discussing the subjects that excite him: not only Buddhist texts, but also language learning and educational philosophy.\nOn the benefits of learning a second language, for example, he opines: “If you don’t know a second language, just learn one. Not having a second language is practically like missing a limb . . . one of the most important lessons [from learning another language] is that things can be done differently — even apparently simple or obvious things can be said differently, or thought differently.”\nKeeping an open mind, embracing the uncertainty that comes with true learning, and always remaining up for a new challenge — these are the qualities that characterise the best academic minds, minds like Michael’s that never seem to settle for the status quo. And increasingly, even in the humanities, these minds are turning to computational methods as another way of realising things can be thought — and done — differently.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

People bumped into a few of the problems that commonly arise with complex molecules and then solved these problems with skilled help on hand.

The workshop was taught by the six Modelling Hub post-doctoral fellows, who each drew upon their own unique areas of expertise to design the course material.\nThe two days consisted of a mix of lectures and hands-on tutorials and practical exercises. Coding exercises were taught using python and the nco command line tools. Topics covered included:\n\n\nIntroduction to programming languages and environments\n\n\nClimate model basics and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)\n\n\nGetting started with supercomputing (guest lecture from NeSI)\n\n\nAnalysis and plotting of spatial data\n\n\nAnalysis and plotting of timeseries data\n\n\nDocument preparation in LaTeX\n\n\nWork structure and version control\n\n\nBy the end of the two days, participants were able to find and download climate model data of interest, use simple scripts to process, analyse, and plot those data, integrate those outputs into a typeset document, and use version control software to keep track of changes.\nAn example of a figure that the students learned to create is given below.\nFeedback was very positive. Several participants commented that they really enjoyed the hands-on, practical nature of the workshop and that it introduced them to new tools that they could use in their research straight away. As well as enhancing technical capabilities, the workshop provided a great opportunity for everyone to meet other students and post-docs working in Antarctic research in New Zealand.\nThe next workshop is planned for Winter 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Brief summary of our March survey",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Prior to our inaugural workshop, we asked the university community to let us know what type of software and modelling tools they use for research. We received 22 complete surveys and, while this is not a particularly large sample, the range of responses still gives key insights into the tools and software used by our community.\nThe first survey question asked which programming languages respondents regularly use for research. Each of our participants identified 2.5 languages on average. R was the most popular (≈55%) and was closely followed by Python (50%) and C/C++ (≈45%). There was then a gap to the next few languages with Matlab and Fortran coming in as a tie (≈23% each) and then Julia (≈18%) and Mathematica (≈14%). This was followed by a variety of languages which each received one or two votes.\nIt is not surprising that the high level and incredibly versatile languages R and Python topped the list, but it was interesting to note that lower-level languages such as C/C++ and Fortran are also widely used. Another interesting observation is that of those that identified only a single language (≈32%) the overwhelming majority of those were R users. This suggests to me that the R environment is so versatile that many of its users have little need for additional tools. On the other hand, all our Python users identified additional languages that they use, among which C/C++ was most common. This accords with my own experiences, and supports the view that Python is an excellent gateway to learning other languages.\nOur second survey question asked about specific uses of different programming languages and tools. To avoid the risk of identifying any individuals it suffices to say there was a diverse range of uses that our survey participants identified. Common themes were, unsurprisingly, numerical simulation, data analysis and visualisation.\nThe next question assessed the willingness to learn about new languages and/or tools for simulation, modelling and analytics. The majority of responses were yes (≈55%) and the remainder were maybe. Most significantly, no participants responded with no. We then asked our survey participants if they would be able and interested in contributing their own knowledge towards helping other researchers. Again, the overwhelming response was yes (≈59%) followed by maybe (≈27%) followed by just a few no’s. Combined, I think this shows a great enthusiasm for sharing knowledge and learning about new computational tools across our community. These sentiments were echoed in the success of our inaugural workshop and demonstrates that SNAP can play an important role in facilitating/organising such activities.\nOur last question asked about what the most important resource that needs to be more effective/efficient for the purpose of conducting research. Once more there was a diverse range of responses. I’ll briefly summarise a few of the most common themes:\n\nAccess to high performance computers, cloud computing and storage resources.\nMaking more university computers available with capabilities to use/compile a range of programming languages (including more Fortran compilers), particularly for teaching purposes.\nBetter communication of what software and data sets are available within VUW.\nAccess to other people, particularly those experienced in working with data and statistical models/methods.\n\nYet again I think these present areas where SNAP can play an important role, particularly with respect to communicating the expertise that people have in specific software/tools and helping to connect those that may be able to help each other.\nGoing forwards we intend to periodically poll the university community on this topic. This will be useful in monitoring the evolving needs of our researchers and students and will guide the development of SNAP activities which will be of most benefit.\nCheers,\nBrendan\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Docking can be used to predict binding conformations and compare binding affinities of small molecules to the target site.”\n\nVictoria University of Wellington hosts a site license for the state-of-the-art Schrödinger Suite, which contains molecular modelling software that could be used in both small molecule drug discovery and material science projects.\nSchrödinger Suite uses advanced graphical user interface (GUI), Maestro, which not only acts as the contact point to all programs in the suite, but also is a powerful tool for visualizing and interacting with molecules and systems of interest.\n\nThe workshop was aimed at interested staff and postgraduate students who would like to explore and employ ligand docking calculations in their research.\nFor this introductory hands-on workshop we focused on first getting acquainted with Maestro, and then conducting a couple of simple ligand docking calculations. The workshop consisted of the following sections:\n\n\nGetting started and familiar with Maestro, the GUI for Schrödinger Suite\n\n\nVisualizing protein-ligand interactions\n\n\nPreparing protein and ligand structures for docking calculations\n\n\nConducting ligand docking calculations and evaluating the results comparing different docking protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the day of the workshop, 19th April 2023, we had a total of 16 attendees (1 undergraduate student, 2 Masters students, 11 PhD candidates, and 2 postdoctoral fellows) from across the University, including people from the School of Biological Sciences, Ferrier Research Institute, and School of Chemical and Physical Sciences. The workshop ran from 9 am to 3:30 pm. Most attendees were able to follow the prepared instructions and complete all the tasks before the end of the workshop. With the training they’ve had, some attendees were able to discuss and start to work on their own projects during the last hours of the workshop.\nThe day was in a great success, with positive feedback from the attendees. We will be using this constructive suggestions to make further improvements for future workshops in this series. We hope to see you again next time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Aspects of such analyses range from practical considerations such as how to clean and normalise a text, to wanting to query information about the text, such as its length and other lingusitic properties. In many instances, adopting a computational approach to these analyses is good practice because it provides a degree of consistency and efficiency when compared to manual human analysis. Computational approaches also make possible previously impossible tasks, such as analysing hundreds, thousands, or millions of texts for various linguistic properties.\nYet, learning how to perform computational anlayses of texts might seem daunting to some researchers, especially if they have not learned any computer programming or other anlaytic approaches in the past."

The purpose of was to provide a gentle introduction to three pieces of technology which can provide any researcher with the tools needed to perform basic computational analyses of texts.\nThe first tool is Google Colaboratory - think of it like a Google Doc that can run code. Using a Google Colab notebook allows one to get right into coding without worrying about installing anything on their computer. The second tool is the programming language Python - which is built right into the Colab notebook. The third tool is the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK)], a Python library designed to perform a wide variety of computational linguistic analyses. And yes, NLTK is also built right in. All you need for the workshop is a web browser, a Google account, and a desire to learn.\nThe materials are open source and hosted on Github, including instructions for explaining the material and providing examples. This means means that interested parties who did not attend the workshop can benefit from self study of the material. Others can add to or tweak the materials as they see fit, either by copying the repo or suggesting edits to the original, allowing for repurposing and recycling for more specific applications.\n\n\n\nThe Workshop Materials\n\n\nWhat’s more is that during the workshop, the materials were tested on CloudStor’s SWAN which can be accessed with VUW credentials. We’ll be seeing about the potential for these tools to be used for similar purposes in the future."

Three of the attendees also benefitted by attending a Software Carpentry workshop in the preceding days, allowing them to chain together their freshly-learned Python knowledge and the material in this workshop.\nThe workshop ran for about 3 hours and attendees were able to successfully split Seinfeld quotes into words, count the frequency of terms in the Ninja Turtles Theme Song, and check the sentiment of some Lorde lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne attendee who was a bit unsure about learning Python stated that they “actually really liked” the workshop, which is surely the highest praise one could expect to receive. Seriously, though, many participants mentioned the workshop was an enjoyable and easy way to learn about Python and text analysis, which is exactly what we wanted it to be.

The main goal for the event was to provide an opportunity for the SNAP community to come together, get to know each other and share their ideas. I’m pleased to report that the workshop was a success. There were over 30 participants online throughout most of the day and I’ve received numerous positive comments from participants. Moreover, the workshop concluded with overwhelming support to hold similar events on a biannual basis.\nThere were 10 short presentations on a wide range of topics with speakers from many different schools and research centres. Topics included tools for climate/ocean/atmosphere modelling, visualisation in R (with ggplot2 and shiny apps) and Python (with py5), nested sampling for posterior evaluation, uses of docker containers, experiences on designing interfaces for real users, quantum cloud computing tools, applications of matrix diagonalisation and meta-analysis tools in R and Stata. Of course, this brief summary does not do the presentations justice, for more details you can find a copy of the final programme along with slides from several of the presentations via the following links: internal link and external link (note: the latter expires 31/10/2022).\nThe presentations sparked much lively discussion in each of the breakout sessions, and this also continued into the lunch break when several participants met in the Kelburn hub. There was much discussion around the use or Python vs R (including R markdown) for a variety of both research and non-research purposes. Tools to create good graphics and interactive visualisations to help communicate ideas to a broader audience was also a lively topic. Participants provided some good ideas into ways SNAP might facilitate training and raise awareness about the expertise in different tools/software across the university. There was also much interest in having workshops tailored to more specific tools/topics in future.\nI would like to thank all those that participated on the day, and especially to each of our presenters. I would also like to convey a special thanks to those that assisted with the organisation of the event.\nIf you are interested in participating in future SNAP events, please get in touch.\nCheers, Brendan\n\nI really enjoyed the inaugural SNAP workshop.

A hot beverage, a snack and updates on high performance computing – what’s not to like?\n\nHPC morning tea meetings happen several times a year with the intention to run at least once a trimester. In addition to socialising with other Rāpoi users (from those who are just starting to weathered HPC veterans), these meetings are an important way to stay have your input and learn from the team what are the steps to getting important jobs scheduled and prioritised, and how to negotiate more efficient student access if you intend to use Rāpoi for teaching.\n2022 Rāpoi Usage The April meeting started with a presentation of the 2022 Rāpoi Utilisation Report, featuring data on usage statistics for 2022, also providing a perspective on longer-term trends from 2019 till last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of submitted jobs has increased massively in 2022 compared to previous years with over 65% of the job submissions occurring between October and December: something you might want to keep in mind when planning when to use Rāpoi for your own research! The biggest users in 2022 are ECS (more than 56% of the actual CPU hours used), SCPS (31%), followed by SBS (5%) with the rest of the schools and CPUs only using a small percentage of the actual CPU hours used. If these jobs had been done through external providers like NeSI or AWS, the cost to VUW would have been between 1.84 and 2.56 million NZD.\n\nResults from the User Survey About 15% of the currently active Rāpoi users filled out the annual survey. The majority of them were PhD students or Postdocs, followed by Academic staff, with only a small portion of Research fellows and professional staff. Onboarding has been a predominantly positive experience for everyone although the team takes into account the difficulties associated with delays in approving staff accounts and the barrier to access through VPN was a topic of discussion during the morning tea. Slack remains the preferred communication channel, but changes to its subscription model and cost create the need to come up with an alternative. HackMD and transferring Q&A and support advice from Slack to Wiki were discussed. A short training on how to organise and properly document support advice on the Wiki will be provided this year and the support team is open to suggestions for tools that can serve as a repository for the data that will no longer be held long-term by Slack. Currently the research output created with the help of Rāpoi is tracked through the survey and the Slack channel so the team strongly encourages this information to be added to your publications and Elements profiles. Based on Slack and survey submissions, in 2022 Rāpoi was used for projects which resulted in over 20 journal articles and conference papers, published in journals with an average impact factor of 8.79. Output created and submitted for publication in 2022 but published in early 2023 included at least 6 papers in journals with average impact factor of 4.05.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
