<h1>SNAP's monthley coffee</h1>

Join us for coffee with others who use simulation, numerics, analytics, and programming in their research, every third Wednesday of the month from 10:30 to 11:00 at Milk and Honey, Kelburn Campus.

Our social coffee meetings have been a great success with 20+ people at each event.  We had a great PG student turn-out this time, and a good discussion about the success of our student workshops, upcoming events, and things to think about improving for next time.

Drop in to chat with other SNAP members and meet some of the SNAP champions who also form the SNAP planing committee.
