<h1>SNAP's monthly coffee</h1>

Join us for coffee with others who use simulation, numerics, analytics, and programming in their research, every third Wednesday of the month from 10:30 to 11:00 at Milk and Honey, Kelburn Campus.

Our social coffee meetings have been a great success with about 15+ people at each event.  We had a reasonable turn-out this time, and a good discussion about the success of our recent workshops, upcoming events, AI in teaching and research, Wellington weather etc.

Drop in to chat with other SNAP members and meet some of the SNAP champions who also form the SNAP planing committee.
