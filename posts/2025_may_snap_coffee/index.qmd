<h1>SNAP's bimonthley coffee</h1>

Come enjoy a coffee with others who use simulation, numerics, analytics and programming as part of their research.
10.15-11.00, Milk and Honey, Kelburn Campus

Our social coffee meetings have been a great success with 20+ people at each event.  We had a great PG student turn-out this time, and a good discussion about the success of our first student workshop on Latex, and things to think about improving for next time.

Drop in to chat with other SNAP members and meet some of the SNAP champions who also form the SNAP planing committee.
