<h1>REAANZ Consultation</h1>

Tricia and Brendan provided information to Angela Davis of Collective Strategy who is working for REANNZ to help them understand researcher technology needs and barriers when working on international collaborations, especially in relation to Horizon Europe.

REANNZ operates NZ's national research and education network which is critical to NZs eResearch infrastructure, for example your connection to NeSI is via REANNZ, eduroam and the large file-sender application.

The consultation aims to ensure New Zealand's technology infrastructure is fit for purpose for researchers both now and in the future, especially as international collaborations are likely to grow.

The kinds of questions we were asked included: 

1. Do you have access to the technology infrastructure to meet the needs of your research?  For example, secure data transfer and storage, network bandwidth if you're working with large data, etc.
2. Have you seen examples that work well for international counterparts and that you wish we had in New Zealand?
3. Are there ways REANNZ can support researchers better?  For example, awareness of services, international connections, support on funding bids etc
4. Any comments on data governance, use, and access, both local and international.
