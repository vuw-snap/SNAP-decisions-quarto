<h1>SNAP's monthley coffee</h1>

Join us for coffee with others who use simulation, numerics, analytics, and programming in their research, every third Wednesday of the month from 10:30 to 11:00 at Milk and Honey, Kelburn Campus.

Our social coffee meetings have been a great success with 15+ people at each event.  We had a good PG student turn-out this time, and a good discussion about the success of our student workshops, upcoming events, Raapoi related stuff, AI in teaching and research, etc.

Drop in to chat with other SNAP members and meet some of the SNAP champions who also form the SNAP planing committee.
