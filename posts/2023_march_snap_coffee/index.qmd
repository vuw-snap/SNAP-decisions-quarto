<h1>SNAP's bimonthley coffee</h1>

Come enjoy a coffee with others who use simulation, numerics, analytics and programming as part of their research.
10.15-11.00, Milk and Honey, Kelburn Campus

Our social coffee meetings have been a great success with 20+ people at each event.  Academics and researchers have relished the opportunity to meet face-to-face over coffee.  We have a table booked and its easily identifiable with our SNAP logo on display.  

Drop in to chat with other SNAP members and meet some of the SNAP champions who also form the SNAP planing committee.
