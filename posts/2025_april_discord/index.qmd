<h1>SNAP Discord Channel</h1>

One of the reasons SNAP exists is to provide a space for early career researchers, post-grads, and staff to share their tools and their tech questions with each other. After the last postgrad workshop offered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-wrench-b475aa1a4/">Daniel Wrench</a>, some of the attendees decided it would be a good idea to get a SNAP Discord going, specifically for students but open to everyone, to talk about tech needs and what they're working on. So, we set one up!

Talk to you later online, hopefully!
