<h1>Prof. Hunt visits the Centre for eResearch at Auckland University</h1>

In December Prof. Hunt, the SNAP lead, was in Auckland for a conference and dropped into visit the much larger Centre for eResearch at Auckland University. She was welcomed by Prof. Mark Gahegan the Director and met the (university funded) team of 7 staff.  We discussed how the Centre for eResearch is doing many of the things that SNAP wants to provide for VuW academics, exploring the challenges and successes.
