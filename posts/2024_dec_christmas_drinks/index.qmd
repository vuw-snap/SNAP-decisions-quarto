<h1>SNAP Christmas Drinks</h1>

On 4th December, SNAP committee members had their end-of-year Christmas drinks at the Kelburn Pub.

This rounds out a year where SNAP members have supported a reduced technical team for Raapoi and where many members have had challenging work schedules due to colleagues leaving.  

We have run many workshops, watched AI and ML grow worldwide, provided input into resource scoping, talked nationally about our journey and most importantly stayed connected and supported each other.
