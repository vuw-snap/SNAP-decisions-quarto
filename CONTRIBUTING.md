Instructions for building and editing files are in the [README](README.md). All interactions are moderated by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Besides that, if you have any questions or thoughts, open an issue! Or, if you're on campus and interested in talking about SNAP, reach out to one of the people on the website.
